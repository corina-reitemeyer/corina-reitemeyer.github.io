      <h2>Hi! I&apos;m Corina ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer, with 6-7 years experience working as a
        Senior UX/UI Designer in the tech industry. My journey into technology
        began in my teens, where I explored both design and coding out of
        personal interest. After dedicating a significant portion of my career
        to UX/UI design, I decided to shift gears from design to delve deeper
        into programming. In March 2024, I enrolled in a fast-paced 17-week
        bootcamp at Dev Academy to specialise in Full Stack Web Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My aim is to create easy-to-use software that enhances users&apos; trust
        and improves their experience with digital products, keeping things
        simple and enjoyable. I prioritise best practices and thrive on
        continuous learning, embracing new technologies to deliver valuable
        results. I find fulfilment in tackling challenges, whether it&apos;s
        through coding or design.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not in front of my computer, I enjoy Latin dancing and
        Reformer Pilates outside of coding, and I&apos;m a massive fan of cozy
        games!
