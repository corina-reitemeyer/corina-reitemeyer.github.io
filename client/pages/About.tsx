          <p className="paragraph">
            I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer, backed with 6-7 years experience
            working as a Senior UX/UI Designer in the tech industry. My journey
            into technology began in my teens, where I explored both design and
            coding out of personal interest. After dedicating a significant
            portion of my career to UX/UI design, I decided to shift gears from
            design to delve deeper into programming. In March 2024, I enrolled
            in a fast-paced 17-week bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa to
            specialise in Full Stack Web Development.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            My aim is to create easy-to-use software that enhances users&apos;
            trust and improves their experience with digital products, keeping
            things simple and enjoyable. I prioritise best practices and thrive
            on continuous learning, embracing new technologies to deliver
            valuable results. I find fulfilment in tackling challenges, whether
            it&apos;s through coding or design.{' '}
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            When I&apos;m not in front of my computer, I enjoy Latin dancing and
            Reformer Pilates outside of coding. I&apos;m also a massive fan of
            cozy games!
