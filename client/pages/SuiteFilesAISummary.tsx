        scope="Lengthy, multi-document signing requests created frictionâ€”recipients struggled to understand what they were signing, while senders had to provide context separately through emails or briefings, leaving it disconnected from the documents themselves. But what if GenAI could take the heavy lifting, leaving users to do what matters mostâ€”signing and preparing documents? I led the strategy and redesign of this feature by shaping the AI approach from a UX perspectiveâ€”defining how it should behave within the workflow and ensuring users retained transparency and control. The result was an AI-powered summarisation tool that streamlined the signing process: recipients could quickly grasp context, and senders could personalise summaries without starting from scratch. Beyond this feature, the work set a model for the companyâ€™s AI-first direction, influencing how AI is integrated across the product."

        body="I approached the feature by reframing the problem at a system level: how could AI reduce friction in the signing journey while preserving trust and control? I defined the humanâ€“AI interaction principlesâ€”transparency, editability, and user agencyâ€”that guided every design decision. Rather than treating AI as an add-on, I positioned it as a strategic layer in the workflow, prototyping and testing interaction models that balanced automation with human judgment. The process established a model for responsible, user-centred AI that the company continues to build on."
