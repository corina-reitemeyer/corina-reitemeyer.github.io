        scope="The challenge wasnâ€™t signing multiple documents â€” it was understanding them quickly. Recipients struggled to grasp what they were signing, while senders had to explain context separately through emails or briefings â€” disconnected from the documents. What if AI could handle the heavy lifting, while people focused on signing and preparing documents? I led the strategy and design, defining how AI should fit into the workflow â€” keeping users in control and ensuring transparency. The result: an AI-powered summarisation tool that streamlined signing. Recipients quickly grasped context, and senders could personalise summaries without starting from scratch. Beyond this feature, the work also became a blueprint for the companyâ€™s AI-first direction, shaping how AI is integrated across the product."

        body="I reframed the problem at a system level: how could AI reduce friction in signing while preserving trust and control? To guide decisions, I defined three humanâ€“AI principles: transparency, editability, and user agency. Rather than treating AI as an add-on, I positioned it as a strategic layer in the workflow â€” balancing automation with human judgment. I worked closely with engineers, who best understood the AI modelâ€™s capabilities and limits. Their insight shaped what we could do immediately, what we couldnâ€™t, and what we might enable in the future. This collaboration ensured the design was both ambitious and technically grounded. Working in a lean startup environment, I focused on clarity over complexity, shipping a simple, responsible first release that users could trust. This set a model for how AI would be integrated across the product moving forward."
