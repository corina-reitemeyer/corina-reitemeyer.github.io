        scope="Lengthy, multi-document signing requests created frictionâ€”recipients struggled to understand what they were signing, while senders had to provide context separately through emails or briefings, leaving it disconnected from the documents themselves. I led the strategy and redesign of this feature by shaping the AI approach from a UX perspectiveâ€”defining how it should behave within the workflow and ensuring users retained transparency and control. The result was an AI-powered summarisation tool that streamlined the signing process: recipients could quickly grasp context, and senders could personalise summaries without starting from scratch. Beyond this feature, the work set a model for the companyâ€™s AI-first direction, influencing how AI is integrated across the product suite."
