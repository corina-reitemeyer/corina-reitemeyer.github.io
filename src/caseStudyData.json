    "overview": "Ritmo is an interactive app designed to help users learn and practice Latin dance moves through video tutorials and step-by-step guides, complementary to going to live classes.",
    "objectiveGoals": [
      "Create an engaging user interface",
      "Develop a centralised comprehensive dance move library that is easy to understand for different skill levels",
      "Facilitate easy navigation and search functionality",
      "Incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement",
      "Provide instructions for follower and leads dancers"
    ],
    "background": "During dance practicas or socials, I frequently encounter leads inquiring about particular moves they're trying to remember and recreate. As a dance instructor, it's essential for me to have access to this library either for guiding my students towards it or utilising it myself. This way, I can provide them with the correct move to reference if they wish to practice it independently.",

    "designProcess": {
      "research": "As I am around dancers all the time, I conducted semi-informal interviews with a couple of students in the community as well as fellow instructors, who shared their experience with me. I distilled all the goals, needs, and painpoints with respective user personas, and mapped out possible user journey flow charts which inform possible features for MVP or MVP+.",
      "definingProblem": "Users struggle to find cohesive and organized resources for learning Latin dance moves. Something that came out quite frequently is that there are several different naming conventions, which can mean different moves depending where you are taught. Because the moves are often in Spanish, non-Spanish speakers either mishear the calls or can't remember them, which does not help when they are trying to look them up online.",
      "ideation": "Brainstormed various features like a video library, save functionality, search bars (and what exactly users can use to look up moves - in this case a descriptive search may be useful aside from keywords). Students and instructors tend to look up moves in class or practicas, so designing mobile-first is an essential approach for it's success.",
      "prototyping": "Developed wireframes and interactive prototypes using Figma, focusing on userflows, user personas and interface design. At this stage I am focusing on a minimal viable product, which includes the moves library and a profile where users can save their moves for future reference. I have designed the streaks and tracking for a Phase 2 implementation, depending how fast I get the developed.",
      "feedback": "So far I have shown the wireframes to a few students, who gave really good constructive feedback such as including rueda hand signals and providing several sources of video content to be able to view the move from different angles.",

Kept functionality to an MVP state for now (the library, user profile and onboarding flow). Whilst the tracking features are really good to have, I found that for the main pain point that being able to look up, read about and save moves is more crucial than trying to track progress. However having features to intiate motivation into the students to keep practising and learning is definitely one of the main factors for long-term sucess of the app.",
      "accessibilityUsability": "Ensured compliance with WCAG guidelines for improved accessibility. So far this as been established with colour contrast checks, using ARIA labels when developing the app and creating a accessibility-friendly layout. The next step I want to incorporate might be a dark/light UI switch for those who struggle with astigmatism or similar. It would also be good to get the app tested with users who have accessibility needs to see whether the current implementation is actually working for those users.",
      "challengesFaced": "Overcame initial technical hurdles related to video streaming and user data management. I have to incorporate open-source links via Youtube to get video content currently, as there are lots of moves to cover. The tracking feature I'm currently looking into will require some research and upskilling in particular tech frameworks that can handle this task.",

Will continue gathering feedback each phase of rolling out changes.",
      "technicalInsights": "Investing in a solid backend architecture pays off during scaling and feature expansion. I learned that SQLite might be stretched with the amount of moves I might need to documents (for one style it's fine - approx. 200 moves), but any further upscalling may need a more rebust SQL database.",
      "improvements": "Future updates should focus on enhancing personalisation and supporting students on their own journeys - each student has a different background and a different reason to why they started dance classes. It's important to support those needs on a equity-based lens, rather than creating a universal solution that is trying to 'fit all' but may miss certain students."

      "summary": "Ritmo so far successfully combines a straight-forward, simple design with robust functionality to create a valuable resource for Latin dance enthusiasts. However, as it is still in its infancy, there is still lots of potential and scope to explore that makes this app even more useful to the latin dance community.",
      "demonstrationSkills": "Showcased skills in UX design, full stack development, and user-centered research. Incorporating regular testing session with local students. Exploring dark UI design and improve auto-layout skills for mobile."

The lack of a unified design system meant that coming up with a design, and building it was a lot slower than we could afford (the project retrospective highlighted several crucial painpoints, all relating back to slow turnover and low confidence on development and design decisions).
