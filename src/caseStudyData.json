      "challengesFaced": "Faced challenges related to integrating various features seamlessly and optimizing the app for different devices and operating systems. We had a large team, so we had to carefully plan out 2-3 workstreams ad overall areas that everyone worked on simutanously. Due to my UX design background, I decided to take ownership of the front-end, as I knew the wireframes very well and I wanted to learn how to use the Tailwind CSS framework and implement React's use methods in different ways.

      "improvements": "We didn't get around to implement any tests (Test-driven Development) and test our wireframes with any of our peers, which would have been something we would have to plan in to begin with. We had team members, who go quite excited about the project, to the point where they got carried away and added more features even through we were already stretching the MVP to it's limit. Being adaptive is good, but I think those add-ons were done without the buy-in by the entire team. Auth0 needs to be setup so that anyone can login/register, including a fleshed out user journey and screens for this part of the product."
