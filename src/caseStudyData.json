    "date": "June - July 2024",
    "overview": "Grow-Grub is a comprehensive app designed to help gardening enthusiasts effortlessly plan, track, and manage their vegetable gardens, catering to both beginners and seasoned gardeners.",
    "objectiveGoals": [
      "Simplify garden management by integrating planning, tracking, and care into a single platform.",
      "Enhance gardening success rates with features such as automated care reminders and progress tracking.",
      "Provide a user-friendly experience tailored to both novice and experienced gardeners.",
      "Offer personalized advice and seasonal tips to help users make informed gardening decisions."
    ],
    "background": "Grow-Grub was developed to address the challenges of vegetable gardening by providing an integrated platform that simplifies garden planning, tracking, and management. The app was conceived to meet the needs of the growing number of individuals interested in sustainable living and home gardening.",

      "/images/optional/grow-grub-background.png"],
    "designProcess": {
      "research": "Conducted extensive market research to understand the needs and preferences of vegetable gardeners. Analyzed existing solutions to identify gaps and opportunities.",
      "definingProblem": "Existing resources are often overwhelming or insufficiently tailored to the specific needs and preferences of veggie gardeners, leading to uncertainty about plant selection, layout, planting schedules, and maintenance practices. A solution is needed that simplifies planning and maintenance of the garden, providing a planning tool and reminders to ensure the plants thrive and produce a successful harvest.",
      "ideation": "Developed user personas and prioritized features based on research findings and MVP scope. Focused on functionalities like garden planning, plant tracking, care reminders, and plant information.",
      "prototyping": "Created low-fidelity wireframes as a team, to facilitate buy-in by the whole team and feasibility check. I went and created high-fidelity wireframes, to ensure we have a cohesive user experience and a plan for how the user interface looks.",

    "softwareDevelopment": {
      "techStack": "We tried to use most of the technologies that have been introduced to us during the bootcamp. Used React for cross-platform development, Gemini API to access plant data, and storig data with SQLite3 (with Knex) for backend services. We used Tailwind CSS to keep the components and styling consistent throughout the product, the front-end was built predominantely with React and TypeScript. We used Auth0 to authenticate the user with a register page and login functionality.",
      "architecture": "Implemented a modular architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend components. Ensured scalability and maintainability of the app.",
      "developmentProcess": "Followed an agile development process with regular sprints and iterative merges. Employed continuous integration and deployment practices to ensure timely updates. We worked on features in pairs or solo.",
      "integration": "Integrated frontend and backend systems, ensuring seamless synchronization of data and smooth user experience across different devices."
    },
    "solutionImplementation": {
      "designDecisions": "Focused on creating a clean, intuitive interface with a natural color scheme to enhance user engagement. Incorporated features like interactive garden layouts and automated care reminders.",
      "codingProcesses": "Employed best practices in coding, including modular development, code reviews, and automated testing to ensure high-quality software.",
      "deployment": "Originally deployed the app to a Dev Academy's Dokku host - however this was a short-term solution and we need to explore an alternative where we can host the app longer.",
      "challengesFaced": "Faced challenges related to integrating various features seamlessly and optimizing the app for different devices and operating systems. We had a large team, so we had to carefully plan out 2-3 workstreams ad overall areas that everyone worked on simutanously. Due to my UX design background, I decided to take ownership of the front-end, as I knew the wireframes very well and I wanted to learn how to use the Tailwind CSS framework and implement React's use methods in different ways. "
    },
    "lessonsLearned": {
      "designInsights": "Most of the peers I worked with never worked with a designer before, so I had to take care to explain decisions and design patterns carefully.",
      "technicalInsights": "Gained in-depth knowledge about front-end development. I always spread myself across full-stack, but I wanted to ensure that I started gaining deeper knowledge in React, which to this point I felt just scraped the surface",
      "improvements": "We didn't get around to implement any tests (Test-driven Development) and test our wireframes with any of our peers, which would have been something we would have to plan in to begin with. We had team members, who go quite excited about the project, to the point where they got carried away and added more features even through we were already stretching the MVP to it's limit. Being adaptive is good, but I think those add-ons were done without the buy-in by the entire team. Auth0 needs to be setup so that anyone can login/register, including a fleshed out user journey and screens for this part of the product."

    "keyTakeaways": {
      "summary": "Grow-Grub successfully addressed the need for a comprehensive gardening app by combining various features into a cohesive platform, enhancing user gardening experiences. We implemented a solid MVP product, with ideas for future enhancements.",
      "demonstrationSkills": "Demonstrated skills in user-centered design, cross-platform development, and agile project management. Worked in pair and solo programming sessions, led couragous conversations by positively challenging the team of making product decisions, particularly in the planning stage of the product."
