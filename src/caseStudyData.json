Due to my UX design background, I decided to take ownership of the front-end, as I knew the wireframes very well and I wanted to learn how to use the Tailwind CSS framework and implement React's use methods in different ways. But this also meant that I was a bit further removed from the back-end as anticipated, and this caused miscommunication to some parts that we wanted to display visually e.g. we had a few missing vegetable icons and plant care instructions, because I wasn't aware we got this data from Gemini.",

At the end of the project, they did give me the feedback that this helped them immensely for envisioning what the product would look like. It created a sense of certainty and agreement of what we were going to build together. I was very aware of keeping the design incredibly simple, mainly because of the tech spikes we had to explore (e.g. Gemini API and React Grid) in a very short time frame, and all of us code at different speeds. As a designer, I would have fleshed it out a little more if I had a bit more time for the design process.",

I always spread myself across full- in our grou projects at the course, but I wanted to ensure that I started gaining deeper knowledge in React, which to this point I felt just scraped the surface. Instead of Gemini, we originally wanted to implement Perenual API, but ran into a pay wall and therefore had to switch direction.",
        "improvements": "We didn't get around to implement any tests (test-driven development) and test our wireframes with any of our peers, which would have been something we would have to plan into our process to begin with. Additionally, we had team members who go quite excited about the project, which caused them to get carried away and added more features even though we were already stretching the MVP to it's limit. Being adaptive is good, but some of those add-ons were done without the buy-in by the entire team. This caused some pressure on other workstreams, as additional dependencies were created, and also meant that we lost a bit of oversight on what the final product would contain in terms of functionality.

          "accessibilityUsability": "Ensured compliance with WCAG guidelines for accessibility. However, web accessibility was set as a stretch goal by the teacher, so we did not get around to implementing it.",
          "challengesFaced": "Encountered challenges with the bridges list (favouritising and activating bridges that are collecting tolls). We also wanted to utilise the Waka Kotahi API to show the location of each bridge, but we found out that this was no longer possible due to limiting the use of the API for third-party users.",

          "demonstrationSkills": "Demonstrated skills in full-stack development, including frontend design, backend integration. Showcased ability to work within a team and manage a project from conception to near deployment stage. I was able to take the role as the product owner, and therefore take leadership in the planning stages, make executive decisions alongside the teacher of keeping workstreams on track. As the product owner and designer, I also took advocacy of the user."
